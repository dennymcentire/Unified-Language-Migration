Experticity Analytics Collector
===============================

The purpose of this code is to communicate with the analytics collector
service via JavaScript. It is currently intended for browser use, but if
there is a demand to have it on the server side, then go tell someone.

Installation
============

Install this bad boy by running the following:

    npm install --save exp-analytics-collector --registry http://build01/nexus/content/groups/npm-all/

This code can be used across a number of different environments. More
specifically:

### ES2015 modules (i.e. babel)

    import expAnalyticsCollector from 'exp-analytics-collector';
    expAnalyticsCollector.init(/* ... */);

### CommonJS

    const expAnalyticsCollector = require('exp-analytics-collector');
    expAnalyticsCollector.init(/* ... */);

### Browser global

    <!-- for IE9 and up -->
    <script src="dist/analytics-collector.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        window.expAnalyticsCollector.init(/* ... */);
    </script>

    <!-- for IE8 and up -->
    <script src="dist/analytics-collector.legacy.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        window.expAnalyticsCollector.init(/* ... */);
    </script>

The IE8 version comes with both es5-shim and es5-sham because it sucks at
life. Otherwise, the plain minified version should be sufficient.

Examples/Documentation
======================

There is currently no official documentation/wiki like thing. Instead, there
is a more interactive way of learning about the library. Do the following:

    # clone the repo, i.e.
    # git clone http://{username}@stash.experticity.com/scm/plat/exp-analytics-collector.git
    cd exp-analytics-collector
    npm install
    npm start
    # Go to localhost:3000 in a browser

If this is stupid and people don't like it, then tell someone to write plain
old boring documentation.
