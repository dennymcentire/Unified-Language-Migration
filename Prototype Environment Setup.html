- Sign into Stash and create a new empty repository.
- Use the command line and navigate into the directory where you want the prototype to live.
- Run the git clone command that Stash created and gave to you. It will look something like this:
$ git clone http://denny.mcentire@stash.experticity.com/scm/uxp/onboarding-flow.git

- Run the following in the folder from the command line.
$ brew install node
$ npm install

- You can now add the repository to the Git client if you want. Go into the client and click "File/Add Local Repository..."

- Once this is done, run the following command anytime you are editing less files
$ gulp watch:less
